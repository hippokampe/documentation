## How did the idea come about?

### Work-flow

When I started my first trimester in Holberton, I saw that every day, I did the same:

1. Go to the intranet.
2. Check the current projects.
3. Read the documentation and tasks.
4. Understand the basics.
5. Copy the prototypes, commands, code, etc.
6. Try to make the tasks.
7. Learn in the process.
8. Get stressed and frustrated.
9. Try again.
10. And that's

That is how it almost looks like a normal day. I'm not saying that it's boring, what I'm saying is that is the first 5 steps, are almost the same, so we as a software engineer, we want to have a tool that helps us and greatly facilitates our lives and days.

### The foundations

And that is when the first questions came from:

- Where is the place where we stay almost all day?
- What a software engineer prefers, keyboard, or mouse?
- What are the main actions that need to have?
- What it's the scope that will have?

### The first walls

And the answers:

- Console
- Keyboard
- Check your code and generate a project
- Use it by the global community and recognized as the official tool by Holberton
